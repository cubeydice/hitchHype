# hithcHype
hitchHype is a platform connecting drivers and riders for long-distance carpooling with an emphasis on saving on gas money and reducing carbon emissions.

## Background and Overview
With rising gas prices and the ever-increasing concern of climate change, going on road trips can be a financially and ethically-motivated decision. hitchHype allows users to alleviate their worries by pairing potential drivers and passengers to create a more fun and eco-friendly alternative to driving alone, while keeping more money in their pockets.

Drivers can create a trip listing, welcoming potential passengers to hitch a ride. It's as simple as
1. Picking a date for their trip
2. Deciding how many riders they want to accomodate, and
3. Entering a start location and destination location

People looking for a ride can browse these listings to join trips, where they can request dropoff points along the way. They can view a variety of trips and filter based on start location, destination, and trip date. Simply select a trip, and press a button to join a ride.

Drivers can then decide whether to keep the hitchHyper, and contact them through their listed phone number.
